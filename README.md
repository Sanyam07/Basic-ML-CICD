# Basic ML CICD
Repo exemplifying basic concepts of CICD for machine learning

This project makes use of a simple classifier using Tensorflow 2.0 to predict 
the label of an image belonging to the fashion MNIST dataset.

To simple test the app in your local server:

- navigate to /flask-app
- execute `flask run`

Once the app is up an running, go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` and load 
and image located in `/data/test/` and follow instructions in that page.
